# Express Server Template

This is a template for a backend express server which can be customized to fit the needs of a specific project. It is error free as is but has no functionality other than a single proof-of-life route.

## Setup

Clone the repo using a git bash terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jed-Staley/express-server-template.git
cd express-server-template
npm install
```

## Usage

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```
